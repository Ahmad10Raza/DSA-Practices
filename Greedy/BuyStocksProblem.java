// In a stock market, there is a product with its infinite stocks. The stock prices are given for N days,
// where arr[i] denotes the price of the stock on the ith day. There is a rule that a customer can buy 
// at most i stock on the ith day. If the customer has k amount of money initially, find out the maximum 
// number of stocks a customer can buy. 

// For example, for 3 days the price of a stock is given as 7, 10, 4. You can buy 1 stock worth 7 rs on day 1,
//  2 stocks worth 10 rs each on day 2 and 3 stock worth 4 rs each on day 3.

// Examples: 

// Input : price[] = { 10, 7, 19 }, 
//               k = 45.
// Output : 4
// A customer purchases 1 stock on day 1 for 10 rs, 
// 2 stocks on day 2 for 7 rs each and 1 stock on day 3 for 19 rs.Therefore total of
// 10, 7 * 2 = 14 and 19 respectively. Hence, 
// total amount is 10 + 14 + 19 = 43 and number  of stocks purchased is 4.


// Approach: The idea is to use greedy approach, where we should start buying product from the day when the stock price is 
            // least and so on. So, we will sort the pair of two values i.e { stock price, day(ith ->index) } according to the stock price, 
            // and if stock prices are same, then we sort according to the day. 
            // Now, we will traverse along the sorted list of pairs, and start buying as follows: 
            // Let say, we have R rs remaining till now, and the cost of product on this day be C, and we can buy atmost
            // L products on this day then,  total purchase on this day (P) = min(L, R/C) 
            // Now, add this value to the answer 
            // total_purchase = total_purchase + P, where P =min(L, R/C) 
            // Now, subtract the cost of buying P items from remaining money, R = R â€“ P*C. 
            // Total number of products that we can buy is equal to total_purchase.

// Java program to find maximum number of stocks that can be bought with given constraints.
