// Given an array of N integers where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. 
// Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that: 

// Each student gets one packet.
// The difference between the number of chocolates in the packet with maximum 
// chocolates and the packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.
// Examples:

// Input : arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56} , m = 3 
// Output: Minimum Difference is 2 
// Explanation:
// We have seven packets of chocolates and we need to pick three packets for 3 students 
// If we pick 2, 3 and 4, we get the minimum difference between maximum and minimum packet sizes.

// Input : arr[] = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12} , m = 5 
// Output: Minimum Difference is 6 

// Input : arr[] = {12, 4, 7, 9, 2, 23, 25, 41, 30, 40, 28, 42, 30, 44, 48, 43, 50} , m = 7 
// Output: Minimum Difference is 10 

// Approach: The idea is based on the observation that to minimize the difference, 
            // we must choose consecutive elements from a sorted packet. 
            // We first sort the array arr[0..n-1], then find the subarray of size m
            // with the minimum difference between the last and first elements.
// Follow the steps mentioned below to implement the approach:


// Initially sort the given array. And declare a variable to store the minimum difference, 
//     and initialize it to INT_MAX. Let the variable be min_diff.
// Find the subarray of size m such that the difference between the last
//      (maximum in case of sorted) and first (minimum in case of sorted) elements of the subarray is minimum.
// We will run a loop from 0 to (n-m), where n is the size of the given array and m is the size of the subarray.
// We will calculate the maximum difference with the subarray and store it in diff = arr[highest index] â€“ arr[lowest index]
// Whenever we get a diff less than the min_diff, we will update the min_diff with diff.
