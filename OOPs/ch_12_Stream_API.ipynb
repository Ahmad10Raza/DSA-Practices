    "# Stream ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stream API is a powerful addition to Java introduced in Java 8 that facilitates functional-style operations on sequences of elements, such as collections. It enables developers to express complex data manipulations and transformations in a concise and readable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are key concepts and features of the Stream API:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Stream:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Stream is a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations. Streams are not data structures; instead, they represent a view of the data and provide a set of high-level operations to perform computations on the data. A Stream does not modify the underlying data source; instead, it produces a new Stream with the desired computations applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Creating Streams:\n",
    "\n",
    "Streams can be created from various sources, including collections, arrays, and I/O channels. Some common ways to create streams are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **From a Collection:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  List<String> list = Arrays.asList(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\");\n",
    "  Stream<String> streamFromList = list.stream();\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **From an Array:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  String[] array = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"};\n",
    "  Stream<String> streamFromArray = Arrays.stream(array);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **From a Stream Builder:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  Stream<String> streamFromBuilder = Stream.<String>builder().add(\"apple\").add(\"banana\").add(\"orange\").build();\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **From a Stream Generator:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  Stream<String> streamGenerated = Stream.generate(() -> \"apple\").limit(3);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Intermediate and Terminal Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Streams support two types of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intermediate Operations:** These operations transform a stream into another stream. Examples include `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`, `distinct`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Terminal Operations:** These operations produce a result or a side-effect. Examples include `forEach`, `collect`, `reduce`, `count`, `anyMatch`, `allMatch`, and `noneMatch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Pipelining:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stream operations can be pipelined to form a larger operation. Pipelining allows you to express complex transformations in a concise and chained manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\");\n",
    "\n",
    "long count = fruits.stream()\n",
    "                   .filter(fruit -> fruit.startsWith(\"a\"))\n",
    "                   .map(String::toUpperCase)\n",
    "                   .count();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we filter fruits starting with \"a,\" transform them to uppercase, and then count the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Parallel Streams:\n",
    "\n",
    "Streams can be processed sequentially or in parallel, providing a simple and powerful way to achieve parallelism. Parallel processing can improve performance for certain types of operations on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\");\n",
    "\n",
    "long count = fruits.parallelStream()\n",
    "                   .filter(fruit -> fruit.startsWith(\"a\"))\n",
    "                   .map(String::toUpperCase)\n",
    "                   .count();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `parallelStream` method is used to process the stream in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\");\n",
    "\n",
    "// Using Stream API to filter and collect\n",
    "List<String> result = fruits.stream()\n",
    "                          .filter(fruit -> fruit.startsWith(\"a\"))\n",
    "                          .map(String::toUpperCase)\n",
    "                          .collect(Collectors.toList());\n",
    "\n",
    "System.out.println(result);  // Output: [APPLE]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use the Stream API to filter fruits starting with \"a,\" transform them to uppercase, and collect the result into a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stream API simplifies data processing, makes code more readable, and provides a foundation for parallel processing in Java applications."
