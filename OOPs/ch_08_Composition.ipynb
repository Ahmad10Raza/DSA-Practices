    "# Composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves constructing complex objects by combining simpler objects. In composition, a class includes references to other classes as part of its member variables. This allows for building relationships between classes, promoting code reuse, modularity, and flexibility in design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points about Composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Has-A Relationship:**\n",
    "   - Composition represents a \"has-a\" relationship between classes. For example, if a class `Car` has a composition relationship with a class `Engine`, it means that a `Car` has an `Engine`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code Reusability:**\n",
    "   - Composition allows for code reuse by creating modular and reusable components. Instead of inheriting functionality through class inheritance, a class can reuse functionality by including instances of other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility in Design:**\n",
    "   - Composition provides greater flexibility in design compared to class inheritance. Objects can be composed of other objects, and changes to one class do not necessarily affect the behavior of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - Composition supports encapsulation by allowing objects to encapsulate the behavior of their constituent objects. Each class can have its own methods and attributes, and the internal details of one class are hidden from the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example with a `Car` class composed of an `Engine` class and a `Wheel` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Engine class\n",
    "class Engine {\n",
    "    void start() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Engine started\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    void stop() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Engine stopped\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Wheel class\n",
    "class Wheel {\n",
    "    void rotate() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Wheel rotating\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Car class composed of Engine and Wheel\n",
    "class Car {\n",
    "    private Engine engine;\n",
    "    private Wheel[] wheels;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Car() {\n",
    "        this.engine = new Engine();\n",
    "        this.wheels = new Wheel[]{new Wheel(), new Wheel(), new Wheel(), new Wheel()};\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    void start() {\n",
    "        engine.start();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    void stop() {\n",
    "        engine.stop();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    void drive() {\n",
    "        for (Wheel wheel : wheels) {\n",
    "            wheel.rotate();\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Car is moving\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Car` class is composed of an `Engine` and an array of `Wheel` objects. The `Car` class owns instances of the `Engine` and `Wheel` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `start`, `stop`, and `drive` methods of the `Car` class delegate to the corresponding methods of the `Engine` and `Wheel` classes. The `Car` class encapsulates the behavior of its components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The composition relationship is established in the constructor of the `Car` class, where instances of `Engine` and `Wheel` are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Usage of Composition\n",
    "public class CompositionExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Car myCar = new Car();\n",

    "# Advantages of composition over inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition and inheritance are both important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), and each has its own set of advantages and use cases. However, there are situations where composition is preferred over inheritance. Here are some advantages of composition over inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flexibility and Modifiability:**\n",
    "   - Composition allows for greater flexibility in design and is more adaptable to changes. With composition, you can easily modify the behavior of a class by changing or adding components without affecting other parts of the system. This is particularly beneficial in situations where requirements are likely to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reduced Coupling:**\n",
    "   - Composition reduces the coupling between classes. When a class is composed of other classes, it is not tightly bound to the implementation details of those classes. This loose coupling makes the code more maintainable and less prone to unintended side effects when changes are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code Reusability:**\n",
    "   - Composition promotes code reuse by allowing the reuse of individual components in different contexts. Components can be used in multiple classes, leading to more modular and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Behavior:**\n",
    "   - Composition allows for dynamic behavior at runtime. Objects can be composed or decomposed during the program's execution, providing greater flexibility in constructing complex objects based on changing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Avoidance of Fragile Base Class Problem:**\n",
    "   - The Fragile Base Class Problem occurs when changes to a base class (inherited class) can unintentionally break the functionality of derived classes. Composition avoids this problem because changes to one class don't impact the behavior of other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - Composition supports encapsulation by allowing objects to encapsulate the behavior of their constituent objects. Each class can have its own methods and attributes, and the internal details of one class are hidden from the other, promoting information hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Easier Testing:**\n",
    "   - Testing is simplified when using composition because each component can be tested independently. This allows for more focused unit testing, making it easier to identify and fix issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Better Support for Interface-Based Programming:**\n",
    "   - Composition aligns well with interface-based programming, where classes implement interfaces and can be composed of multiple interfaces. This approach provides a more modular and flexible structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **No Diamond Inheritance Issues:**\n",
    "   - Composition avoids the complexities and potential issues associated with diamond inheritance problems. In multiple inheritance scenarios, composition can be a simpler and safer alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Improved Design for Certain Scenarios:**\n",
    "    - Certain design patterns, such as the Strategy Pattern or the Decorator Pattern, are more naturally implemented using composition. These patterns allow behavior to be composed dynamically at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "While composition has its advantages, it's essential to note that both composition and inheritance have their places in OOP, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of a given design. In many cases, a combination of both composition and inheritance might be the most effective approach."
