    "# Composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves constructing complex objects by combining simpler objects. In composition, a class includes references to other classes as part of its member variables. This allows for building relationships between classes, promoting code reuse, modularity, and flexibility in design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points about Composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Has-A Relationship:**\n",
    "   - Composition represents a \"has-a\" relationship between classes. For example, if a class `Car` has a composition relationship with a class `Engine`, it means that a `Car` has an `Engine`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code Reusability:**\n",
    "   - Composition allows for code reuse by creating modular and reusable components. Instead of inheriting functionality through class inheritance, a class can reuse functionality by including instances of other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility in Design:**\n",
    "   - Composition provides greater flexibility in design compared to class inheritance. Objects can be composed of other objects, and changes to one class do not necessarily affect the behavior of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - Composition supports encapsulation by allowing objects to encapsulate the behavior of their constituent objects. Each class can have its own methods and attributes, and the internal details of one class are hidden from the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example with a `Car` class composed of an `Engine` class and a `Wheel` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Engine class\n",
    "class Engine {\n",
    "    void start() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Engine started\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    void stop() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Engine stopped\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Wheel class\n",
    "class Wheel {\n",
    "    void rotate() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Wheel rotating\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Car class composed of Engine and Wheel\n",
    "class Car {\n",
    "    private Engine engine;\n",
    "    private Wheel[] wheels;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Car() {\n",
    "        this.engine = new Engine();\n",
    "        this.wheels = new Wheel[]{new Wheel(), new Wheel(), new Wheel(), new Wheel()};\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    void start() {\n",
    "        engine.start();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    void stop() {\n",
    "        engine.stop();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    void drive() {\n",
    "        for (Wheel wheel : wheels) {\n",
    "            wheel.rotate();\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Car is moving\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Car` class is composed of an `Engine` and an array of `Wheel` objects. The `Car` class owns instances of the `Engine` and `Wheel` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `start`, `stop`, and `drive` methods of the `Car` class delegate to the corresponding methods of the `Engine` and `Wheel` classes. The `Car` class encapsulates the behavior of its components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The composition relationship is established in the constructor of the `Car` class, where instances of `Engine` and `Wheel` are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Usage of Composition\n",
    "public class CompositionExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Car myCar = new Car();\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Using methods of the Car class, which internally use Engine and Wheel\n",
    "        myCar.start();\n",
    "        myCar.drive();\n",
    "        myCar.stop();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `main` method, an instance of the `Car` class is created, and its methods are invoked. This example illustrates how composition allows for building complex objects by combining simpler objects, promoting code reuse and modularity."
