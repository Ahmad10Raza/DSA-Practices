    "# Defining and implementing interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, an interface is a way to achieve abstraction by declaring a set of abstract methods without providing implementations. A class that implements an interface must provide concrete implementations for all the methods declared in that interface. Here's an example to illustrate defining and implementing interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Define an Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Interface definition\n",
    "interface Animal {\n",
    "    void makeSound();  // Abstract method\n",
    "    void move();       // Another abstract method\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Animal` interface declares two abstract methods: `makeSound` and `move`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Implement the Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Class implementing the Animal interface\n",
    "class Dog implements Animal {\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void makeSound() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Dog barks\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void move() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Dog walks\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Dog` class implements the `Animal` interface by providing concrete implementations for both `makeSound` and `move` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Create an Instance and Use the Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class InterfaceExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        // Create an instance of Dog\n",
    "        Dog myDog = new Dog();\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Use the interface methods\n",
    "        myDog.makeSound();  // Output: Dog barks\n",
    "        myDog.move();       // Output: Dog walks\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `main` method, we create an instance of the `Dog` class and use the `makeSound` and `move` methods, which are part of the `Animal` interface. This demonstrates polymorphism, as we are treating the `Dog` object as an `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Default and Static Methods (Java 8 and later):**\n",
    "   - Starting from Java 8, interfaces can also contain default and static methods with implementations. These methods allow adding new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Updated interface with default method\n",
    "interface Animal {\n",
    "    void makeSound();  // Abstract method\n",
    "    void move();       // Another abstract method\n",
    "\n",
    "    default void sleep() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Animal sleeps\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    static void communicate() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Animals communicate\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Interface Implementation:**\n",
    "   - A class can implement multiple interfaces. This allows for multiple inheritance of method signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Example with multiple interfaces\n",
    "interface Carnivore {\n",
    "    void eatMeat();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Wolf implements Animal, Carnivore {\n",
    "    // Implement methods from both interfaces\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Wolf` class implements both the `Animal` and `Carnivore` interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces are powerful tools for achieving abstraction and creating flexible and extensible code. They allow for the definition of a common set of methods that can be implemented by different classes, promoting code reuse and polymorphic behavior."

    "# Default and static methods in interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from Java 8, interfaces can have default and static methods, providing a way to add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. Let's explore both default and static methods in interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "A default method is a method in an interface that provides a default implementation. It allows adding new methods to an interface without forcing all implementing classes to provide an implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Example interface with a default method\n",
    "interface Greeting {\n",
    "    void sayHello();  // Abstract method\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Default method with an implementation\n",
    "    default void sayDefaultHello() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Default Hello!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `sayDefaultHello` is a default method with a default implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Implementing class for the Greeting interface\n",
    "class EnglishGreeting implements Greeting {\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void sayHello() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Hello!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",

    "public class InterfaceExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        EnglishGreeting englishGreeting = new EnglishGreeting();\n",
    "\n",
    "        englishGreeting.sayHello();          // Output: Hello!\n",
    "        englishGreeting.sayDefaultHello();   // Output: Default Hello!\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `EnglishGreeting` class implements the `Greeting` interface, providing an implementation for the `sayHello` method. It can also utilize the default method `sayDefaultHello` without providing an implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "A static method in an interface is a method that is associated with the interface itself, not with any instance of the interface. It is invoked on the interface, not on an instance of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Example interface with a static method\n",
    "interface MathOperations {\n",
    "    // Static method with an implementation\n",
    "    static int add(int a, int b) {\n",
    "        return a + b;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `add` is a static method in the `MathOperations` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Usage of the static method in the main program\n",
    "public class InterfaceExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        int sum = MathOperations.add(5, 3);\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Sum: \" + sum);   // Output: Sum: 8\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The static method `add` is invoked on the interface itself, and it performs the addition operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Default Methods:**\n",
    "  - Use default methods when you want to add new methods to an existing interface without breaking existing implementations.\n",
    "  - Provide default implementations for methods that can be shared among multiple implementing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static Methods:**\n",
    "  - Use static methods for utility methods that are associated with the interface but do not depend on the state of any instance.\n",
    "  - Provide common functionality that is independent of the specific implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Default and static methods in interfaces contribute to the evolution and flexibility of codebases by allowing the addition of new methods and utility functions without disrupting existing implementations."

    "#  Multiple inheritance through interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, multiple inheritance is achieved through interfaces. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit the method signatures from each interface. This is in contrast to class inheritance, where a class can extend only one superclass. Let's look at an example to understand multiple inheritance through interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Interface 1\n",
    "interface Flying {\n",
    "    void fly();\n",
    "}\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have two interfaces: `Flying` and `Swimming`. The `Bird` class implements both of these interfaces, allowing it to inherit and provide concrete implementations for the `fly` and `swim` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Usage in the main program\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Bird` class, by implementing both `Flying` and `Swimming` interfaces, can exhibit behavior associated with both flying and swimming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations for Multiple Inheritance through Interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conflicting Method Signatures:**\n",
    "   - If two or more interfaces being implemented have methods with the same signature, the implementing class must provide an implementation for that method, resolving the conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Diamond Problem:**\n",
    "   - The diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. In Java interfaces, this problem is resolved because the compiler enforces that the implementing class provides a concrete implementation for the conflicting method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Interface A\n",
    "interface A {\n",
    "    void commonMethod();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Interface B extends A\n",
    "interface B extends A {\n",
    "    void commonMethod();  // Conflicting method\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Interface C extends A\n",
    "interface C extends A {\n",
    "    void commonMethod();  // Conflicting method\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Class implementing multiple interfaces with conflicting methods\n",
    "class D implements B, C {\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void commonMethod() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Implementation in class D\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `D` class implements both `B` and `C` interfaces, which extend the common interface `A`. The `commonMethod` is provided with a concrete implementation in the `D` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Usage in the main program\n",
    "public class DiamondProblemExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        D d = new D();\n",
    "        d.commonMethod();  // Output: Implementation in class D\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility and Composition:**\n",
    "   - Interfaces provide a flexible way to compose and reuse code. A class can implement multiple interfaces based on the specific functionalities it needs, promoting a composition-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance through interfaces in Java allows for the creation of flexible and modular codebases, enabling classes to inherit behavior from multiple sources. It is a key feature of Java's interface-based programming paradigm.\n",

    "# Functional interfaces and lambda expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, a functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. Functional interfaces are used to represent functional concepts and are a key feature of Java's support for functional programming. With the introduction of lambda expressions in Java 8, functional interfaces became more prominent, as lambda expressions provide a concise way to express instances of functional interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "A functional interface can have multiple default or static methods, but it must have exactly one abstract method. It is annotated with the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation to ensure that it meets the requirements of a functional interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a functional interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@FunctionalInterface\n",
    "interface MyFunctionalInterface {\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lambda Expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda expressions provide a concise syntax for expressing instances of functional interfaces. They allow you to treat functionality as a method argument, creating a more expressive and readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "In this example, the lambda expression `() -> { System.out.println(\"Implementation of myMethod\"); }` is used to create an instance of `MyFunctionalInterface`. The lambda expression provides a concise way to express the implementation of the single abstract method `myMethod`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Functional Programming:**\n",
    "   - Functional interfaces and lambda expressions enable a more functional programming style in Java, allowing the use of higher-order functions and passing behavior as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Concurrency:**\n",
    "   - They are particularly useful in concurrent programming with the introduction of the `java.util.concurrent` package, where functional interfaces are used to represent tasks and lambda expressions provide concise ways to express them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stream API:**\n",
    "   - Functional interfaces and lambda expressions are extensively used in the Stream API, allowing developers to express operations on streams in a more readable and concise way.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n",
    "\n",
    "// Using lambda expression with Stream API\n",
    "numbers.stream()\n",
    "    .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)\n",
    "    .map(n -> n * n)\n",
    "    .forEach(System.out::println);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Event Handling:**\n",
    "   - They are commonly used in event handling scenarios, such as with the `ActionListener` interface in graphical user interface (GUI) programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Using lambda expression for an ActionListener\n",
