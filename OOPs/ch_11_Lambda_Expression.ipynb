    "# Introduction to functional programming in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, where you express the logic of a computation without explicitly describing the flow control. Java, while primarily an object-oriented language, has introduced functional programming features starting from Java 8 with the introduction of lambda expressions and the Stream API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are key concepts and features of functional programming in Java:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Lambda Expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda expressions introduce anonymous functions to Java. A lambda expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous function (a function without a name). It allows you to treat functionality as a method argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "(parameters) -> expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Traditional approach using an anonymous class\n",
    "Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {\n",
    "    public void run() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "// Lambda expression\n",
    "Runnable lambdaRunnable = () -> System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Functional Interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional interfaces are interfaces that have exactly one abstract method. They are used to provide target types for lambda expressions. The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is optional but can be used to ensure that the interface is intended for use as a functional interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@FunctionalInterface\n",
    "interface MyFunctionalInterface {\n",
    "    void myMethod();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Streams API:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Streams API provides a functional approach to processing collections of data. It allows you to express complex data manipulations in a concise and readable way. Streams can be parallelized to take advantage of multi-core architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "List<String> words = Arrays.asList(\"hello\", \"world\", \"functional\", \"programming\");\n",
    "\n",
    "// Using Stream to filter and collect\n",
    "List<String> result = words.stream()\n",
    "                          .filter(word -> word.length() > 5)\n",
    "                          .map(String::toUpperCase)\n",
    "                          .collect(Collectors.toList());\n",
    "System.out.println(result);  // Output: [WORLD, FUNCTIONAL, PROGRAMMING]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Functional Interfaces in `java.util.function`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Java 8 introduced several functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package, such as `Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, and `Supplier`, which represent common function types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Predicate: Check if a string has length greater than 3\n",
    "Predicate<String> lengthGreaterThan3 = s -> s.length() > 3;\n",
    "System.out.println(lengthGreaterThan3.test(\"Java\"));  // Output: true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Method References:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method references provide a shorthand notation for a lambda expression. They can make your code more readable by referring to methods by their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "List<String> words = Arrays.asList(\"hello\", \"world\", \"functional\", \"programming\");\n",
    "\n",
    "// Using method reference toUpperCase\n",
    "List<String> result = words.stream()\n",
    "                          .map(String::toUpperCase)\n",
    "                          .collect(Collectors.toList());\n",
    "System.out.println(result);  // Output: [HELLO, WORLD, FUNCTIONAL, PROGRAMMING]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming in Java brings more expressive and concise ways to write code, making it easier to reason about and maintain. It encourages immutability, which helps in avoiding side effects and makes code more predictable. While Java's functional programming features may not be as extensive as in purely functional languages, they provide a valuable addition to the language."

    "# Syntax and usage of lambda expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda expressions in Java provide a concise way to express instances of single-method interfaces (functional interfaces). They allow you to treat functionality as a method argument and create instances of functional interfaces more easily. The syntax of a lambda expression consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parameter List:** The parameters of the lambda expression, enclosed in parentheses. If there are no parameters, you still need to use empty parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Arrow (->):** The arrow operator, which separates the parameter list from the body of the lambda expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Body:** The body of the lambda expression, which contains the code to be executed. If the body consists of a single expression, you can omit the curly braces `{}`. If the body contains more than one statement, you must use curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the general syntax of a lambda expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "(parameters) -> expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "(parameters) -> { statements; }\n",

    "# Functional interfaces and the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, a functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. Functional interfaces are a key concept in functional programming, and they are used in conjunction with lambda expressions to provide a concise way to represent anonymous functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is an optional annotation that can be used to declare that an interface is intended to be a functional interface. While the annotation itself is not strictly necessary for an interface to be functional, using it helps communicate the intended purpose of the interface to both developers and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of functional interfaces and the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Functional Interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "A functional interface can have multiple default or static methods, but it must have only one abstract method. This abstract method represents the single function that the interface is designed to encapsulate. Functional interfaces are used as the target types for lambda expressions and method references.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a functional interface without `@FunctionalInterface` annotation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public interface MyFunctionalInterface {\n",
    "    void myMethod();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `@FunctionalInterface` Annotation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is used to explicitly declare that an interface is intended to be a functional interface. While it is optional, using this annotation helps catch accidental violations of the functional interface contract by the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a functional interface with `@FunctionalInterface` annotation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@FunctionalInterface\n",
    "public interface MyFunctionalInterface {\n",
    "    void myMethod();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Default and Static Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional interfaces can have multiple default or static methods, and adding such methods doesn't break the functional interface contract. These methods can provide utility functions or additional behavior without affecting the functional nature of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@FunctionalInterface\n",
    "public interface MyFunctionalInterface {\n",
    "    void myMethod();\n",
    "\n",
    "    default void anotherMethod() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Default method\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    static void staticMethod() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Static method\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use with Lambda Expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional interfaces are often used in conjunction with lambda expressions to create concise and expressive code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@FunctionalInterface\n",
    "interface MyFunctionalInterface {\n",
    "    void myMethod();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class LambdaExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        // Using lambda expression\n",
    "        MyFunctionalInterface myFunctionalInterface = () -> System.out.println(\"Hello, Lambda!\");\n",
    "        myFunctionalInterface.myMethod();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is optional but provides clarity about the intended purpose of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using functional interfaces and lambda expressions in Java promotes a more functional style of programming, enabling developers to write more expressive and concise code. The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation serves as a helpful tool for documenting and enforcing the single abstract method requirement in the interface."

    "        System.out.println(\"Sum: \" + sum);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Example 1:** We use a lambda expression in the `forEach` method to print each number in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example 2:** We use a lambda expression in the `map` method to square each number and then use another lambda expression in the `forEach` method to print the squared values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example 3:** We use a lambda expression in the `filter` method to select only even numbers and then use another lambda expression in the `forEach` method to print the even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Example 4:** We use a lambda expression in the `reduce` method to calculate the sum of all numbers in the list.\n",
    "\n",

Lambda expressions allow you to write more readable and declarative code by expressing the operations you want to perform in a clear and compact way."
