    "# Access Modifiers\n",
    "In Java, access modifiers are keywords that determine the visibility or accessibility of classes, methods, and other members within a program. They control which parts of a program can access a particular class, method, or field. Java provides four main access modifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Public (`public`):**\n",
    "   - The most permissive access level.\n",
    "   - Classes, methods, and fields declared as `public` can be accessed from any other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   public class MyClass {\n",
    "       public int publicVariable;\n",
    "       public void publicMethod() {\n",
    "           // Code here\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Private (`private`):**\n",
    "   - The most restrictive access level.\n",
    "   - Members declared as `private` are only accessible within the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   public class MyClass {\n",
    "       private int privateVariable;\n",
    "       private void privateMethod() {\n",
    "           // Code here\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Protected (`protected`):**\n",
    "   - Members declared as `protected` are accessible within the same class, package, and subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   public class MyClass {\n",
    "       protected int protectedVariable;\n",
    "       protected void protectedMethod() {\n",
    "           // Code here\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Default (Package-Private):**\n",
    "   - If no access modifier is specified (default), it is also known as package-private.\n",
    "   - Members with default access are accessible within the same class and package.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   class MyClass {\n",
    "       int defaultVariable;\n",
    "       void defaultMethod() {\n",
    "           // Code here\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access modifiers apply to classes, methods, and fields.\n",
    "- The choice of access modifier affects the visibility of a member and influences encapsulation.\n",
    "- Access modifiers are crucial for designing classes with a clear API (Application Programming Interface) and controlling access to the internal implementation.\n",
    "- It's common to use `public` for methods that form the external interface of a class, while keeping the internal details hidden using `private` and `protected`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using access modifiers appropriately helps in creating well-encapsulated, modular, and maintainable code. It also contributes to the principle of information hiding, where the internal details of a class are hidden from the outside world, allowing for better control and flexibility in the design of software systems."

    "# Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and is often described as the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. The key idea behind encapsulation is to restrict direct access to some of an object's components and hide the internal details of how an object's state is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key aspects of encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Hiding:**\n",
    "   - Encapsulation involves the concept of data hiding, where the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside world.\n",
    "   - The internal details, such as the structure of data and implementation of methods, are not accessible directly by external code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access Control:**\n",
    "   - Access modifiers (public, private, protected, and default) are used to control the visibility of class members (fields and methods).\n",
    "   - Public members are accessible from anywhere, while private members are only accessible within the class, achieving a level of control over the exposure of internal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information Bundling:**\n",
    "   - Encapsulation bundles data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit or class.\n",
    "   - The class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, and the details of how the data is stored and manipulated are encapsulated within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implementation Independence:**\n",
    "   - Encapsulation provides a way to achieve implementation independence. The external code interacting with an object doesn't need to know how the internal details are implemented.\n",
    "   - The internal implementation can be changed without affecting the external code as long as the public interface remains consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Enhanced Modularity:**\n",
    "   - Encapsulation promotes modularity by organizing the code into self-contained units (classes).\n",
    "   - Each class encapsulates its own state and behavior, allowing for easier maintenance, testing, and understanding of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Security and Validation:**\n",
    "   - Encapsulation enables the enforcement of validation rules and security measures by controlling access to the internal state of an object.\n",
    "   - By using private members and providing controlled access through methods (getters and setters), developers can ensure that data is manipulated in a controlled and secure manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, encapsulation in OOP is the practice of bundling the data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class) and controlling the access to the internal details. It promotes data hiding, information bundling, and enhanced modularity, contributing to better code organization, maintenance, and security."

    "# Getter & Setter Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Getter and setter methods are used to access and modify the private fields (attributes) of a class. They are a common practice in object-oriented programming (OOP) and are associated with the concept of encapsulation. Getter methods retrieve the values of private fields, while setter methods modify the values of those fields. The primary purpose of using getter and setter methods is to control access to the internal state of an object and ensure that data is manipulated in a controlled and consistent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more detailed explanation of getter and setter methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getter Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**\n",
    "  - Retrieve the value of a private field (attribute) from an object.\n",
    "- **Naming Convention:**\n",
    "  - Typically named with the prefix \"get\" followed by the name of the attribute (e.g., `getName()`).\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  public class Person {\n",
    "      private String name;\n",
    "\n",
    "      // Getter method for 'name' field\n",
    "      public String getName() {\n",
    "          return name;\n",
    "      }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Usage:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  Person person = new Person();\n",
    "  String personName = person.getName();\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setter Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**\n",
    "  - Modify the value of a private field in an object.\n",
    "- **Naming Convention:**\n",
    "  - Typically named with the prefix \"set\" followed by the name of the attribute (e.g., `setName()`).\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  public class Person {\n",
    "      private String name;\n",
    "\n",
    "      // Setter method for 'name' field\n",
    "      public void setName(String newName) {\n",
    "          this.name = newName;\n",
    "      }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Usage:**\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  Person person = new Person();\n",
    "  person.setName(\"John Doe\");\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose and Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - Getter and setter methods help achieve encapsulation by controlling access to the internal state of an object.\n",
    "   - The fields are often declared as private, and access to them is provided through public getter and setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation and Security:**\n",
    "   - Setter methods allow for validation checks before modifying the value of a field. This helps enforce rules and maintain data integrity.\n",
    "   - Security measures can be implemented within setter methods to control access to sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility and Modifiability:**\n",
    "   - Using getter and setter methods provides a level of abstraction, allowing for changes to the internal representation of data without affecting the external code.\n",
    "   - It facilitates future modifications and enhancements to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Readability and Documentation:**\n",
    "   - Getter and setter methods improve code readability by providing a clear interface for accessing and modifying data.\n",
    "   - They serve as a form of self-documentation, making it evident how the class should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Integration with Frameworks:**\n",
    "   - Many frameworks and libraries in Java, such as JavaBeans, rely on conventions involving getter and setter methods. These conventions enable automated tools and frameworks to interact with classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, getter and setter methods play a crucial role in achieving encapsulation, maintaining data integrity, and providing a clear interface for accessing and modifying the state of an object. They are a fundamental part of good object-oriented design and coding practices."

    "# Object V/s Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms \"instance\" and \"object\" are often used interchangeably in programming, but they do have subtle distinctions. Let's clarify these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:**\n",
    "  - An object is a tangible entity that exists in memory and is an instance of a class.\n",
    "  - It represents a specific occurrence or realization of a class, and it has its own unique identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creation:**\n",
    "  - When you use the `new` keyword to create an instance of a class, you are creating an object.\n",
    "  - Example: `Person person = new Person();` creates a `Person` object named `person`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage:**\n",
    "  - Objects are used to access the instance variables and invoke the instance methods defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:**\n",
    "  - An instance refers to a single occurrence or occurrence of an object in memory.\n",
    "  - It is a specific occurrence of a class that has its own set of instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relationship with Object:**\n",
    "  - Every object is an instance, but not every instance is an object. The term \"instance\" emphasizes the idea that it is a specific occurrence of a class, while \"object\" is a more general term.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage:**\n",
    "  - The terms \"instance variable\" and \"instance method\" are often used to describe variables and methods associated with a particular instance (object) of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Person {\n",
    "    // Instance variables\n",
    "    String name;\n",
    "    int age;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Instance method\n",
    "    void displayInfo() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Name: \" + name);\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Age: \" + age);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Creating an object (instance) of the Person class\n",
    "Person person1 = new Person();\n",
    "// Creating another object (instance) of the Person class\n",
    "Person person2 = new Person();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `person1` and `person2` are both objects and instances of the `Person` class. Each of them represents a specific occurrence of the class and has its own set of instance variables (`name` and `age`). The terms can be used interchangeably, but the term \"object\" is often used more casually in everyday conversation, while \"instance\" may be used to emphasize the instantiation of a class."
