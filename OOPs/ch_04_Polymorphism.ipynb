    "# What is Polymorphism?\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows `objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class`. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects and allows a single method or operator to exhibit different behaviors depending on the type of object it is operating on. Polymorphism is often expressed through two related concepts: method overriding and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding):**\n",
    "   - Also known as method overloading.\n",
    "   - Occurs at compile time.\n",
    "   - Multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists can be defined in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   class Calculator {\n",
    "       public int add(int a, int b) {\n",
    "           return a + b;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       public double add(double a, double b) {\n",
    "           return a + b;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding):**\n",
    "   - Also known as method overriding.\n",
    "   - Occurs at runtime.\n",
    "   - A subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   class Animal {\n",
    "       public void makeSound() {\n",
    "           System.out.println(\"Generic animal sound\");\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Dog extends Animal {\n",
    "       @Override\n",
    "       public void makeSound() {\n",
    "           System.out.println(\"Bark, bark!\");\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Shape {\n",
    "    public void draw() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Drawing a shape\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle extends Shape {\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void draw() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Drawing a circle\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Square extends Shape {\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void draw() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Drawing a square\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class PolymorphismExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        // Creating objects of different shapes\n",
    "        Shape shape1 = new Circle();\n",
    "        Shape shape2 = new Square();\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Calling the draw method on different shapes\n",
    "        shape1.draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle\n",
    "        shape2.draw(); // Output: Drawing a square\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `Shape` is a base class, and `Circle` and `Square` are subclasses. The `draw` method is overridden in both subclasses. At runtime, the actual type of the object determines which version of the `draw` method is called. The objects `shape1` and `shape2` can hold instances of `Circle` and `Square`, respectively, and the appropriate `draw` method is invoked based on their actual types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism enhances code flexibility, reusability, and abstraction, allowing code to be more adaptable to different scenarios and reducing dependencies on specific implementations."

    "# Understanding polymorphism in terms of method overloading and method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism in Java is expressed through two related concepts: method overloading and method overriding. These concepts allow a single method name to represent multiple implementations, either within the same class (method overloading) or across a class hierarchy (method overriding).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Overloading:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- Method overloading occurs when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "1. **Same Method Name:**\n",
    "   - Methods in the same class have the same name.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Different Parameter Lists:**\n",
    "   - Overloaded methods must have different parameter lists (different types or different numbers of parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compile-time Polymorphism:**\n",
    "   - The selection of the appropriate method happens at compile time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Calculator {\n",
    "    // Method overloading\n",
    "    public int add(int a, int b) {\n",
    "        return a + b;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public double add(double a, double b) {\n",
    "        return a + b;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `add` method is overloaded with two versionsâ€”one for integers and one for doubles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Overriding:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "1. **Same Method Signature:**\n",
    "   - The overriding method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheritance Required:**\n",
    "   - Overriding happens in the context of an inheritance relationship. The subclass must extend the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Runtime Polymorphism:**\n",
    "   - The selection of the appropriate method happens at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Animal {\n",
    "    public void makeSound() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Generic animal sound\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog extends Animal {\n",
    "    // Method overriding\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void makeSound() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Bark, bark!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Dog` class overrides the `makeSound` method defined in its superclass, `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use an example that involves both method overloading and method overriding:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Shape {\n",
    "    public void draw() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Drawing a shape\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle extends Shape {\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void draw() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Drawing a circle\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Method overloading within the same class\n",
    "    public void draw(int radius) {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Drawing a circle with radius: \" + radius);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Shape` has a method `draw`.\n",
    "- `Circle` overrides the `draw` method and also overloads it with an additional method `draw(int radius)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in a different class or method, you can use polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class PolymorphismExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Shape shape1 = new Circle();\n",
    "        shape1.draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle\n",
    "\n",
    "        Circle circle = new Circle();\n",
    "        circle.draw(5); // Output: Drawing a circle with radius: 5\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `shape1` is declared as a `Shape`, but it refers to an actual object of the `Circle` class. At runtime, the overridden `draw` method in `Circle` is called, demonstrating polymorphism. The `Circle` object can also use the overloaded `draw` method directly. Polymorphism allows code to be more flexible and adaptable, supporting multiple behaviors for the same method name."

    "# The `instanceof` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `instanceof` operator in Java is used to test if an object is an instance of a particular class, an instance of a subclass, or an instance that implements a particular interface. It returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`) based on whether the object is an instance of the specified type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "object instanceof Class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Usage:**\n",
    "   - The `instanceof` operator is used to check the type of an object at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Result:**\n",
    "   - Returns `true` if the object is an instance of the specified class or a subclass.\n",
    "   - Returns `false` if the object is not an instance of the specified class or a subclass.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "public class InstanceOfExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Animal animal = new Dog();\n",

    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `instanceof` operator is used to check whether the `animal` object is an instance of the `Dog`, `Cat`, or `Animal` class. Since `animal` is actually an instance of the `Dog` class (even though it is declared as an `Animal` reference), the first condition is true, and \"The object is a Dog\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Type Checking:**\n",
    "   - It is commonly used for type checking before casting an object to a specific type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (object instanceof SomeType) {\n",
    "    SomeType specificObject = (SomeType) object;\n",
    "    // Perform operations on specificObject\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoiding ClassCastExceptions:**\n",
    "   - It helps prevent `ClassCastException` by checking the type before attempting to cast an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (object instanceof SomeType) {\n",
    "    SomeType specificObject = (SomeType) object;\n",
    "    // Perform operations on specificObject\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    // Handle the case where the object is not of the expected type\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interface Implementation Checking:**\n",
    "   - It can be used to check if an object implements a particular interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (object instanceof SomeInterface) {\n",
    "    // Object implements SomeInterface\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that while the `instanceof` operator can be useful in certain situations, it's generally a good practice to design your code in a way that avoids extensive use of type checking and casting, as it can indicate a need for better abstraction and design."
