    "A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is an abstract data type with two main operations: push (inserting an element onto the stack) and pop (removing the top element from the stack).\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of using a stack compared to other data structures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplicity: Stacks have a simple and intuitive interface, making them easy to understand and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Efficiency: The push and pop operations in a stack have a time complexity of O(1), making them very efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Memory management: Stacks use a fixed amount of memory, making them suitable for situations where memory usage needs to be controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Function call management: Stacks are commonly used to manage function calls in programming languages, allowing for efficient recursion and backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Undo/Redo functionality: Stacks are often used to implement undo and redo functionality in applications, allowing users to revert or repeat actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, stacks are a versatile data structure that can be used in various applications, providing efficient and convenient operations for managing data."
